# UFO
## Fact or Fiction: You be the judge
### As the title would suggest, the purpose of this website is to allow you, the viewer, to decide what you believe about UFOs. What we've accomplished here is a collection of UFO sightings with a simple yet fully-functional search filter. "How do I use the filter?" Excellent question!

## "How Do I Search?"
### As you can see from the image below, there is a "Filter Search" list where you can find what you're looking for. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111928259/210155124-58a1fe95-5302-4fd2-aed7-7cb6155858fb.png)

### Perhaps you want to know what happened on your birthday. If I were to enter my birthday in the "Enter Date" input box, shown below:

### And then I hit the enter button, you will see that sadly on my birthday in 2010, there were not any UFO sightings :(

## "Can I search multiple criteria at once?"
### Short answer? Absolutley! All you have to do is enter however much information you wish to filter! Maybe you want to find all the sightings on January 1, 2010 in the state of California. That's easy! All you have to do is enter your data: 1/1/2010 in the "Enter Date" block, and "ca" in the "Enter a State" block.

## "Wow! This is amazing! Are there any drawbacks to this amazing tool?"
### Sadly, there are. The filter is case-sensitive, meaning if you capitalize "CA" instead of entering it lowercase, like "ca", you won't get any data.

### But, my friends, as we grow together, we will also improve the site! On top of fixing the case-sensitivity of the filter search, there are also two upcoming developments. Soon, we hope to seperate the data table meaning you can scroll withing the table without losing your place on the site. Additionally, we are going to be adding a "Clear Filter" button, so you can go back and forth more easily between filtered data and unfiltered data. 

## In summary
### I had so much fun putting this information together to make it accessible and easy for more people to make up their own minds on UFOs. While there are still improvements to be made, this is a simple yet effective tool for people to use. Happy hunting, folks!
